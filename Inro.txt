. just like another cicd tool like jenkins.

Continuous Integration                                  |       Continuous Deployment 

code push --->>> unit test --->>> security scan (code quality) --->>> build --->>> deploy --->>>  



What is workflow ?
. Worklow is a process contains one or more jobs.
. Worklow will be attached to a repository.
. One repository can have multiple repository.
. job is just like a task eg. test, build etc.

Suppose we only do a comment in the code and push on the branch so we don't need to run the worklow unncessary for that comment instead we can skip :-

- react_deployment git:(main) git add .
- react_deployment git:(main) âœ— git commit -m "added comment [skip ci]"
